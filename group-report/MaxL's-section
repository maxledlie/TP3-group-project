\section{Programming and Technical Challenges}
The goal was to produce a program that would allow the user to input any set of boundary
conditions, and then run one of the three finite difference methods discussed above
repeatedly until further iterations of the method made no change. Then the program should somehow plot the resulting electric and potential fields.

\subsection{The \texttt{grid} variable}
The first problem was to choose a suitable data type to represent the space being investigated. As in any numerical approximation, the continuous space must be divided into a very large number of discrete cells, each representing a point in space. The data structure that was chosen is as follows: \texttt{vector<vector<tuple<double,bool>>>}. This is a 2-dimensional \texttt{vector}, with \texttt{tuple}s as entries, representing the cells.

 The position on the first \texttt{vector} represents the cell's x-coordinate, and the position on the second its y-coordinate. The first entry in the tuple representing the cell is a \texttt{double} value representing the potential at that point, and the second entry is a \texttt{bool} value indicating whether that cell is part of the boundary conditions (true), or not (false). If the cell is part of the boundary conditions, it must never be changed during the operation of the finite difference methods.
 
\subsection{The \texttt{Board} class}
On a higher level, spaces being investigated are represented by members of a class called \texttt{Board}. This class has \textbf{two} of the above data types as variables, called \texttt{grid} and \texttt{new\_grid}. These represent the information about the space before and after the most recent iteration of the chosen finite difference method. The class also has member functions which allow the important operations to be carried out on the board. These functions will be discussed in the order in which they are used by the program.

\subsubsection{Initialisation}
A major challenge in the development of the program was to find a way to allow the user to input arbitrary boundary conditions, in a relatively user-friendly way. The solution that was decided upon is to take input in the form of a Bitmap file. When the function \texttt{bmpInitialise(bmp\_filename)} is called, each pixel in the input Bitmap file is mapped to the corresponding cell in \texttt{grid} and \texttt{new\_grid}. The colour of the pixel is detected. If the pixel is pure red (RGB = 255,0,0), the potential of its corresponding cell is set to +5V, and its boolean is set to true. Similarly, if the pixel is pure green, its potential is set to 0V, and if the pixel is pure blue it is set to -5V. In this manner, the values of \texttt{grid} and \texttt{new\_grid} may be initialised to represent any arrangement of charged plates, cylinders, or any other two-dimensional shape the user chooses.

\subsubsection{Iteration}
The next problem was to write methods that perform single iterations of each of the finite difference methods described in Section 3.1. For the most part this was a simple matter of expressing the equations described in that section in C++ code. However, one technical problem worth commenting on is that of the edge cases. Since the finite difference methods are based on finding the average of neighbouring cells, great care must be taken when finding the next value of the potential for cells on the edge or corner of the grid, since in these cases we must explicitly state that we are looking for the average of, say, the cell to the left of and the cell above in the case of the cell on the bottom-right corner of the grid. Each time one of the finite difference methods is called, it begins by setting \texttt{grid} equal to \texttt{new\_grid}, and updates only \texttt{new\_grid}, so they remain one iteration apart.


\subsubsection{Convergence}
The program should run for only as long as it is doing useful operations. Therefore a function is required that detects when further iterations of the finite difference methods are producing no change in the values of the potential in each cell. This is why we store both \texttt{grid} and \texttt{new\_grid}, rather than just one. We need to be able to compare the current values with the values before the most recent iteration. The function \texttt{converged(precision)} returns true if the difference between the potential in every cell in \texttt{new\_grid} and the potential in the corresponding cell in \texttt{grid} is less than the provided precision value.

\subsubsection{Output}
The function \texttt{writeBoard(output\_filename)} takes the current value of \texttt{new\_grid} and writes it to a three-column data file in the format

%X-COORD		Y-COORD 	POTENTIAL


\subsection{Program Structure}
The overall structure of the C++ program is shown below:

As discussed above, the \texttt{Board} class contains most of the important functions. The actual running of the program is managed in the \texttt{Source} file, which asks the user for input regarding which finite difference method to use, and the desired accuracy level, and creates instances of \texttt{Board} and runs the member functions with appropriate parameters.

\section{Example Application: Silicon Microstrip Detector}
As a demonstration of the capabilities of this program, we present its application to an important physical situation. Silicon microstrip detectors consist of a positively charged 'backplane' opposite a large number of grounded silicon wafers, as shown below:

\end{figure}

These are often used to detect ionising radiation in particle physics experiments. Therefore it is very important to understand the electric field around such arrangements of charge. The first step is to create a Bitmap file representing the situation. A 50x20 pixel Bitmap image was created and is shown below:

\begin{figure}[h!]

\end{figure}

When this file is provided as an argument to the Bash script, the resulting plots for the potential and electric fields are shown below:
